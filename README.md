# IoT
Endpoint for an Industrial Internet of Things sensor.

## About
Atmega328P microcontroller

Embedded C

## Functionality
Measure temperature readings

Error logging

Communicate over Ethernet using RESTful interface

Implements a communication parser in C that is bufferles -- uses the memory in the Ethernet recieve buffer rather than the microcontroller SRAMs

## Goal
Gain experience in programming in a memory-constrained environment
